# The 'coreapi' package
This directory will contain the core API of our application.

As we are creating an application with [CQRS](https://axoniq.io/resources/cqrs) in mind,
 we will keep of focus on the messaging paradigm of using Command-, Event- and Query-Messages as our API.

As this package contains our core API, the classes in this directory should be made public.
