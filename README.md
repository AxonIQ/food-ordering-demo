# Part 1 - The Structure of an Axon Application

This part is specific about the structure of an Axon application.
As such, the main focus of this branch is to provide insights into starting a simple Axon application.

In this you should think about the used dependencies for this project, as found in the `pom.xml`,
 and the basic directory structure of the application.
 
The introduced directories contain a small `description.md` to provide a little background why those are present.

The video relating to this part of the guide can be found [here]().
