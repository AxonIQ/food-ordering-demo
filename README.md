# Part 3 - The Command Model

This part of the guide will introduce the Command Model of our application.
The Command Model in this sense refers to the 'C' in CQRS,
 as is further specified [here](https://axoniq.io/resources/cqrs).  

In this guide, we will introduce an Aggregate,
 how this will handle commands and how to do Event Sourcing on that Aggregate, when utilizing Axon Framework.
If you are interested in specifics on Aggregates,
 checking out our information about [Domain Driven Design](https://axoniq.io/resources/domain-driven-design) is a good starting point.
For additional information about Event Sourcing,
 we would like to refer you to this [page](https://axoniq.io/resources/event-sourcing).
