# Part 2 - Core API

This part of the guide introduces the notion of the Core API package and it's contents.
As an Axon application's API is all about the Command-, Event- and QueryMessages,
 this part focuses on introducing these messages into the application.  

In this guide, we have decided to leverage Kotlin to provide a concise model to describe this API in.
This choice has been made to speed up the implementation time for the video
 and thus should not be regarded as a hard requirement.
You are thus free to decided how you implement your API; POJO's are also a fair option for example,
 as well as leveraging something like Lombok on top of it.
