# The Axon Quick Start Guide 

This repository supports the 'Axon Quick Start Guide' as published by AxonIQ.
This guide consist of several small parts, guiding you through the process of creating an Axon application.

Every part is recorded as a video,
 containing a reference branch in this repository to show the changes made in that part.
Thus, if you are interested in for example part one of the guide, you can checkout the branch `part-1`.
The `README.md` in that branch will provide you the necessary feedback about that part and a link to the video.

To view the end result of all parts combined, the `master` branch should be checked out. 
 
The subject domain of this guide will be that of a Food Ordering service.
The service is expanded upon in every part,
 eventually supplying the information to build a fully fledged application using Axon

The videos relating to this guide can be found on AxonIQ's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/axoniq).
